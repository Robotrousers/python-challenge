## Python-Challenge
Christopher Turner - Wk3Challenge

Notes:
Last week, I began with VSCode for this assignment, but I switched to Jupyter Notebook with the pandas library after being introduced to it in class this week. This combo works MUCH better for my brain. After writing my code there, I exported each as a standard ‘main.py’ script as per the instructions and in case that is your preference for viewing and grading. I used a lot of our class activities files for developing my code as well as looking up certain functions like how to format my print analysis to align with the example results in the instructions, also to learn how to make this readme more helpful and structured.

### This repo contains the following files:

#### PyBank

**bank_main_jup.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and code. This is the file I used to complete the challenge.
**main.py**: Python script exported from the Jupyter Notebook file
**bank_analysis.txt**: Text file with the results of the financial analysis.
**Resources/**: Directory containing data files.
 - `budget_data.csv`: The CSV file with the budget data used for analysis.

#### PyPoll

**poll_main_jup.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and code. This is the file I used to complete the challenge.
**main.py**: Python script exported from the Jupyter Notebook file
**results_analysis.txt**: Text file with the results of the election analysis.
**Resources/**: Directory containing data files.
- `election_data.csv`: The CSV file with the poll data used for analysis.

#### gitbash Screenshot

**gitbash_repo_upload.png**: screenshot of using gitbash to work with github repo

#### README.md

**README.md**: the current file. Provides an overview of the project structure and its contents.
