## Python-Challenge
Christopher Turner - Wk3Challenge

Notes:
Last week, I began with VSCode for this assignment, but I switched to Jupyter Notebook with the pandas library after being introduced to it in class this week. This combo works MUCH better for me. After writing my code in Jupyter, I exported each assignment as ‘main.py’ standard python script per the instructions and in case that is your preference for viewing and grading. I used a lot of our class activities files for developing my code as well as looking up certain functions like how to format my print analysis to align with the example results in the instructions, also to learn how to make this readme more helpful and structured.


### This repo contains the following files:


#### -PyBank Folder
